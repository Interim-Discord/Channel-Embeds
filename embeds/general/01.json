      "description": "Many of us used to be a part of a Slack full of game developers and makers, Games & Play. It was invite-only, but it built up a pretty large userbase of pretty likeminded people.\n\nI never found a community like it. Many servers have not been as likeminded, having people I don't want to talk to (maybe even avoid), they're too meme-filled, etc. \n\nIf you know people who you consider wonderful, technically minded or inspiring, I'd love to have them here.\nHopefully Games & Play people will trickle in as people eventually check slack again.\n\nIt'll likely take a little while to build up a critical mass so please don't feel awkward in the meantime, and **introduce yourselves**!",
